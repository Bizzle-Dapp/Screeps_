### This is my repo of my AI for Screeps.
- In case you didn't know what Screeps is, here is a link to the website: https://screeps.com/ 
- API documentation for the Framework to write the AI can be found here: https://docs.screeps.com/
- Basic Tutorials, Training Rooms and Simulation Sandboxs editable within the browser can be found here: https://screeps.com/a/#!/sim

### My code is a huge mess as i'm still learning...
The entry point for the AI is main.js. Beyond that, it's a free for all.
_debug.js and _usefulCommands.js are essentially notes - they aren't used by the AI.
